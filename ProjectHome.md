This project try to develop sample project using JSF 2 , PrimeFaces 3 , Spring Security 3, JPA , Hibernate, MySQL. I am new for all this technologies but I am very excited to learn all this things.




<b>There are 2 projects involved.</b>

You need to download from SVN , get project :

1) Service Project (sampleAppService).[Security 3 , JPA , Hibernate](Spring.md) Actually this project generate from springfuse (http://www.springfuse.com/). I just generate JPA 2 backend only.

2) Web Project (sampleAppWeb). [2, PrimeFaces 3, Spring Security 3](JSF.md). At Springfuse, we also can generate by chosen (JSF 2, Primefaces 3, Spring WebFlow 2). But for my project, I skip WebFlow. For me it enough to me develop project using JSF 2 + PrimeFaces 3.

What you need to know?

1)You should understand how to use eclipse.

2)You should understand how to use SVN.

3)You should understand how to use maven.

4)You should understand how to use tomcat(I just test using Tomcat 7).

Be happy. Don't struggle to get sample of my code. I also on learning.
You may use http://www.springfuse.com/ to setup your own project using JSF2, primefaces3, spring3 without webflow. Before this they are not provide what we want.
